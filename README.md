# Employment Trends Analysis Using BLS API

Overview

This project analyzes employment trends in the United States over the last decade (2014 - 2024) using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The project involves retrieving data via the BLS API, processing it, and visualizing the results to identify key trends and patterns in employment over time.

Project Features

Data Retrieval: Utilized the BLS API to fetch historical employment data for various industries over the past 10 years.
Data Processing: Cleaned and processed the raw data to prepare it for analysis and visualization using Python's Pandas library.
Data Visualization: Created detailed line charts to illustrate employment trends over time, using Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.
Trend Analysis: Provided insights into employment trends, including the impact of significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. labor market.
Tools and Technologies
Python: The core programming language used for data processing and analysis.
BLS API: Accessed historical employment data using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' API.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and processing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used for creating visualizations to effectively communicate data insights.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for exploratory data analysis and development of the project.
Project Structure
bls_trend_analysis.py: The main script for fetching data from the BLS API, processing it, and generating visualizations.
bls_employment_data.csv: (Optional) A CSV file containing processed data used for additional analysis or backup.
Visualizations: Line charts that display employment trends over the last 10 years.
Key Insights
General Upward Trend: The analysis revealed a consistent upward trend in employment across various industries, indicating economic growth.
Impact of COVID-19: The data shows a significant dip in employment in early 2020, correlating with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a robust recovery.
Seasonal Fluctuations: Regular seasonal patterns were observed, reflecting the cyclical nature of employment in certain sectors.
